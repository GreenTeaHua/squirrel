Example code for split1 of the Breakfast dataset to reproduce our results on the 2017 CVPR paper "Weakly supervised action learning with RNN based fine-to-coarse modeling"

### RUN THE CODE                                                             ###

We assume that you already compiled Squirrel and that the src directory and its
subdirectories containing the binaries are in ../../src/

1) download the data:

    wget -O data.zip https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/index.php/s/yt0MHmQJNzQalJR/download
    unzip data.zip
    rm data.zip


2) train the model:

    ./train.sh
   
   OR download our trained model for Breakfast here:
   https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/index.php/s/lFTlv5obv8JZkc5/download
   and replace results/iter-X in config/decode.config and in decode.sh with the path to the downloaded model


3) decode the test sequences:

    ./decode.sh


4) evaluate the results (this example computes the frame accuracy after five training iterations)

    ./eval.py data/split1.test.labels results/iter-5/decoding.test.labels

Directory "data/":
    contains the data of the first split of the Breakfast dataset. Note that for
    more efficient reading, the train and test feature vectors are stored in
    binary format (split1.train.bin and split1.test.bin). Squirrel can also read
    gzipped or ascii files but reading is slower. In order to convert between
    binary and ascii files, use the converter:

    ../../src/Converter/converter --action=convert-file-format --converter.input=data/split1.test.bin --converter.output=data/split1.test.txt

    If you want to convert in the other direction, specify the file ending on
    .txt of .gz in converter.input and the binary file in converter.output.
    Note that binary files need to end on .bin.

Directory "results/":
    contains the results generated during training and decoding, particularly
    the RNN model files, HMM files, and realigned/decoded label files

Directory "log/":
    contains log files generated by Squirrel. These files contain relavant
    information about the loaded configuration and any important messages that
    occurred during training/decoding.

Directory "config/":
    contains the config files used for the different calls to the Squirrel
    binaries. For further reading on configuration files, see the manual.
