Example code for the decoding of a THUMOS 14 sequence to reproduce our results on the 2016 CVPR paper "Temporal Action Detection using a Statistical Language Model"

### RUN THE CODE                                                             ###

We assume that you already compiled Squirrel and that the src directory and its
subdirectories containing the binaries are in ../../src/

We further assume that you already trained a classical action recognition model
and only provide the pre-trained model files in the "model/" directory here.
Note that Fisher vectors of improved dense trajectories have been used in the paper
but CNN features may be much more efficient.

1) download the data (validation labels/transcripts and FV of IDT for one THUMOS test video)

    wget -O data.zip https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/index.php/s/ZOnt9N85cZlTQHO/download
    unzip data.zip
    rm data.zip


2) decode the test sequence:

    ./decode.sh

   The result of the decoding can be found in the log file "log/decoding.log" at
   the bottom. The format is
   <label 1>:<duration (in frames)> <label 2>:<duration (in frames)>. The output
   of the test sequence should look like this:
   0:21 10:21 0:21 10:12 0:1 10:24 0:45 10:59 0:35 10:20 0:48

   A mapping from label indices to class names can be found in data/class-mapping.txt


Directory "config/":
    contains the config files used for the different calls to the Squirrel
    binaries. For further reading on configuration files, see the manual.
